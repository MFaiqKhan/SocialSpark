# SocialSpark Orchestrator

**SocialSpark Orchestrator** is a social media automation tool designed to help small businesses, marketing teams, and content creators streamline their social media presence across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

This project leverages the **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol**, enabling a modular architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to manage the entire lifecycle of social media posts â€“ from content creation and adaptation to scheduling, platform-specific posting, and analytics.

## Architecture & Technology

The backend for each specialized agent in the SocialSpark Orchestrator is built using **FastAPI**, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python based on standard Python type hints.

### Why FastAPI?

FastAPI is an excellent choice for this A2A-based system due to:

*   **API-First Design:** Naturally aligns with the A2A protocol where agents communicate via well-defined API contracts (tasks and data parts).
*   **Asynchronous Support (`async`/`await`):** Crucial for handling I/O-bound operations common in social media interactions (e.g., calling external platform APIs, waiting for responses) and for building responsive, scalable agent services. This complements A2A's design for potentially long-running tasks.
*   **Data Validation with Pydantic:** Ensures robust and reliable data exchange between agents, adhering to the defined A2A task payloads and `DataPart` structures.
*   **Automatic API Documentation:** Provides interactive documentation (Swagger UI & ReDoc) out-of-the-box, which is beneficial for inter-agent development, testing, and potentially for exposing `AgentCard` information.
*   **Performance:** High-performance capabilities suitable for a system managing multiple agent interactions and user requests.
*   **Python Ecosystem:** Allows leveraging the vast Python ecosystem for social media API client libraries, AI/ML integrations for advanced features, and more.

Each agent (e.g., `Content & Scheduling Agent`, `Platform Posting Agent - Facebook`) is envisioned as an independent FastAPI service, exposing endpoints that correspond to A2A tasks.

## Detailed Design & Development Plan

For a more in-depth understanding of the system, please refer to:

*   **[Agent Flow Design (README-Flow-Design.md)](README-Flow-Design.md):** Details the flow-to-flow interactions and A2A communication patterns between the various agents.
*   **[Development Task Priority (README-Task-Priority.md)](README-Task-Priority.md):** Outlines the phased development roadmap, starting with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and detailing subsequent feature enhancements.

## Getting Started

*(This section would typically include instructions on setting up the development environment, running the FastAPI services, and any other prerequisites. To be filled in as development progresses.)*

This project aims to build a flexible, scalable, and intelligent social media automation solution by combining the power of the Agent2Agent protocol with the efficiency of FastAPI.
